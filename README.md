## MERN Todo App 

This project contains a simple todo application. 
It has following features -
* Backend is done 
* NOTE - I pushed .env intentionally 
Frontend-
* User can sign up
* User can Login in - backend server needs restart every time we login (trying to fix)
* User can create the todo
* User can see Existing todos 
* User can mark a todo as done-working on it (not done yet)
* User can logout
